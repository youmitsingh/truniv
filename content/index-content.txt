UNCOVERING THE TRUTH BEHIND THE JOY OF LIFE

35,000 decisions a day.
That’s what the research says.
But the real question is: where do they come from?

The answer lies in your emotions. They are the compass behind every decision you make—and they’re the ones truly shaping your life’s direction, whether toward joy and fulfillment or stress and sorrow.

But what if that emotional balance was shattered—twisted, distorted, and sealed beneath a false layer? Your daily decisions, now hijacked by illusion, no longer reflect your true self. Beneath that layer, your authentic mind gasps for breath, parched and aching for a sip of truth. A taste of real life.

This book is a beautiful journey into the essence of life itself—a deep dive into what drives our existence. At the core, we’re all propelled by just two forces: stress and relief. Every emotion you feel swings between them. But when you learn to master that balance through true, conscious decisions, you unlock the power to achieve anything you truly desire.

If I may ask you.
What’s that one thing you crave in life to flood it with happiness?

Your answer might just be one of these: ‘money, appreciation, love—and last, but above them all, freedom of choice without hurting anyone’s sentiments.
Everyone wants those things—it's just that people have different priorities.
If we’re all chasing happiness, why are stress, depression, anxiety, sorrow, and failure still catching up with us? And where is that elusive happiness and satisfaction hiding?
Our emotions steer the wheels of our lives—but here’s the twist: most of us are trapped in a false emotional reality. Shocking, right? I thought so too… until one trip flipped my version and perspective. A trip, an unexpected meetup with
friends, and one unforgettable guy—Univ. Packed with knowledge (literally everything!), he became a true mentor and showed me life from a whole new angle with science and spirituality.

Spanning ten chapters, this book examines the fundamental what, why, and how behind life’s most significant questions, touching on themes like—

Money
True Emotions
Your Conscious Mind
Success
Failure
Stress,
Depression
Procrastination
Relationship
Our Future with Artificial Intelligence.

That One Person in Life
We all just need that one hand to hold, or a warm hug with words that say…
“Don’t worry—you’re doing great. I’m right here for you. So keep flying high, and whenever you fall, I’ll be there to catch you and lift you again. Failure is just a steppingstone to success—so rise, keep moving, and chase your dream again.
All I ask of you is just one thing…
'Never quite'. Don’t wait for the perfect moment—get up now and make it yours."
